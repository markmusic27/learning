# ❄️ Bayes' Theorem

Many people talk about Bayes' Theorem. However, only a few truly understand it.

### __Meaning / Importance__

What Bayes' Theorem does is that it signifies the fact that $P(A|B)$ __is not the same__ as $P(B|A)$. 

For example, lets see it with if your a drug user and testing positive for consuming a drug.

_$A$ would be if your a drug user._

_$B$ would be if your tested positive for consuming a drug._

_$P(A|B)$ would be the probability that you tested positive for a drug given that you're a drug user._ 

_$P(B|A)$ would be the probability that you are a drug user given that you tested positive for consuming a drug._ 

__NOTE:__ Just by hearing these, you can already tell that there is a difference that can be critical in cases like these.

### __Formula__

$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$
