# ğŸŒª Conditional Probability

Conditional Probability is the probability of something happening depending on some condition.

>What is the probability of getting christmas presents if I behave well.

### __Math Notation__

$P(A,B)$: Probability of event a and b happening.

$P(A|B)$: Probability of event a happening given that event b happened.

### __Formula__

$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A,B)}{P(A)}$

### __Example__

>I give my students two tests. 60% students pass both tests. The first test was easier and 80% students passed it. What percentage of students who passed the first one passed the second one.

### __More Info__

An important decision you need to make is if the data has any dependencies. Therefor, is it independent or dependant? One of the easiest ways to see if its dependant is if $P(A,B)$ is equal to $P(A)$.

### __Calculating__

- $P(A,B)$ =  $P(A)$ * $P(B)$
- $P(A)$: The quotient of the times the event happened and to total trials.
- $P(AÂ | B)$: $P(A,B)$ / $P(A)$.
