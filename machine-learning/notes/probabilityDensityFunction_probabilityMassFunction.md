# ðŸŽ¸ Probability Density Function & Probability Mass Function

### __Probability Density Function__

A probability density function speaks to the probability of a range of values occurring.

For example, a normal distribution is a probability density function.

In a normal distribution (normal function):

-   __68%__ of the data will fall within the range of $-\sigma$ and $\sigma$ from the $\mu$.
-   __95%__ of the data will fall within the range of $-2\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ from the $\mu$.
-   __99.7%__ of the data will fall within the range of $-3\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ from the $\mu$.

To recap, a probability density function is all about the probability of a data point falling with a specific range

__NOTE:__ The probability density function is only applicable to continuous data since continuous data can be infinitely accurate. That's why it speaks of the probability.

### __Probability Mass Function__

In the other hand, when dealing with discrete data, we call it a Probability Mass Function.

Essentially, what you're doing is plotting a probability density function but since the data is discrete, you quantize it just like you would for a histogram.

This is what the graph means:

-   __The black line__ is the plotted normal probability density function.
-   __The blue and green blocks__ are the now quantized data.
-   __The x axis__ is displaying the actual data points in the data set.
-   __The y axis__ is displaying the probability of the data points occurring in the data set.

So just like you would see the probability of continuous data occurring in a probability density function, you use the probability mass function to see the probability of discrete data occurring.

__NOTE:__ It looks a lot like a histogram because it basically is a histogram.
