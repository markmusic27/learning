# ðŸ›¡ Types of Data

Data is everything in Data Science (hence the name). This is why it's so important to see what data you're working with because that will then be a factor to what models and techniques you use.

#### __There are three major types of data__

1.  Numerical Data
2.  Categorical Data
3.  Ordinal Data

### __Numerical Data__

Numerical is the most common type of data. It's point is to represent some type of quantitative measurement.

> Heights of people, page load times, speed of cars, stock prices, etc

Within this, there is __discrete__ and __continuous__ data.

#### __Discrete Data is when the data is exact and you aren't rounding to get it.__

This data is often integers and easy to count. 

> Number of goals scored, Shoe sizes, etc.

#### Continuous Data is when data is not exact and has infinite possible values.

This data is often rounded and has decimals.

> Race car lap time, inches of rain that fell, height of the buildings in New York

### __Categorical Data__

This is qualitative data that has no mathematical meaning.

Its called categorical data because it can be divided into categories (groups).

> Gender, race, political party, etc.

These categories can be assigned numbers to be more compact. However, these numbers have no mathematical meaning.

### __Ordinal Data__

Ordinal data is like the combination between numerical and categorical.

You have different categories that can be assigned numbers. However, these numbers do have mathematical meaning and can be used to compare one category against another.

> Star rating system for Movies between 1 - 5.

Even though movies will be categorized into these numbers between 1 - 5, you can say that 1 is worse than 5. You couldn't say that democrats are worse than republicans, for example.
